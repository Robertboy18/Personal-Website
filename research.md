I have a range of interests in several fields of inquiry, which causes me to stumble on what I am interested in (Throughout my life, I have always tried to be a *generalist* rather than a *specialist*). 

On the one hand, I am quite
interested in the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning/Reinforcement Learning (i.e., the discipline of Computational Learning Theory), while on the other hand, I am very interested in Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science. Although this topic is rather extensive in its own right, I am particularly interested in the confluence of Complexity Theory and Machine Learning, i.e. PAC Theory ( Probably Approximately Correct or Computational Learning Theory)Lastly, for Graduate school, I am mostly interested in pursuing Theoretical Machine Learning/Reinforcement Learning or Computational Learning Theory.
