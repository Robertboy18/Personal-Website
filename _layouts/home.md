I am a Ph.D. student in Mathematics and Computer Science at Caltech under Professor <a href = "http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Animashree Anandkumar (Nvidia)</a>. I work in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Group <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning">(AI4Science)</a> group. I graduated with the Dean's Silver Medal in Science from the University of Alberta with a degree in Honors Mathematics and Computer Science. My research interests include Deep Learning, Neural Operators, AI4Science, AI4Math, LLM Reasoning and Optimization and Efficient training of foundational models.

I used to work with Professor <a href = "http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/">Martha White</a> and <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/" >Adam White (Google DeepMind)</a> at the Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence <a href = "http://rlai.ualberta.ca/)">(RLAI)</a> Lab led by <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/">Rich Sutton</a> and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute <a href = "https://www.amii.ca/">(Amii)</a>, as well as with Professor <a href = "https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/">John Bowman</a> in the Mathematics Department. I was a CSRMP Research Scholar at <a href = "https://research.google/outreach/csrmp/">Google AI</a> and collaborated with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/data-platform-analytics/">Microsoft Research</a> as a Data Science Intern. I also did research in Numerical Algorithms affiliated with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences <a href = "https://www.pims.math.ca/">(PIMS)</a> and the Applied Mathematics Institute <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~yauwong/AMI.htm">(AMI)</a> where I better contributed to the understanding and developing algorithms for Quasi - Linear PDE's, climate forecasting (AI Computational Team - <a href = "https://www.wishartlab.com/">Wishart Lab</a>), Healthcare (<a href = "https://thecvc.ca/">Canadian VIGOUR center</a>) and Explainable AI <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amiixai/">(xAI)</a>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
I also am interested in giving back to the community by teaching and mentoring students and sharing my love for AI4Science & Math. Used to co-lead the ML Theory Reading Group at <a href="https://cohere.for.ai/">Cohere for AI</a>.
Feel free to contact me if any of these interests align with your research or if you have any questions. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
