I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Mathematics and Computer Science at Caltech under Professor <a href = "http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Animashree Anandkumar (Nvidia)</a>. Currently, I am a senior at the University of Alberta pursuing Honors Applied Mathematics and Computer Science and a research intern at Caltech in the Theoretical Computing Science <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/theoretical-computer-science">(TCS)</a> group. Additionally, I work with Professor <a href = "http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/">Martha White</a> and <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/" >Adam White (DeepMind)</a> at the Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence <a href = "http://rlai.ualberta.ca/)">(RLAI)</a> Lab and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute <a href = "https://www.amii.ca/">(Amii)</a>, as well as with Professor <a href = "https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/">John Bowman</a> in the Mathematics Department. I was a CSRMP Research Scholar at <a href = "https://research.google/outreach/csrmp/">Google AI</a> and collaborated with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/data-platform-analytics/">Microsoft Research</a> as a Data Science Intern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
My research interests include theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning specifically in Computational Learning Theory, Neural Operators, Optimization Theory and Foundations of Deep Learning. During my time at the Explainable AI <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amiixai/">(xAI)</a> Lab I have seen the necessity that humans must understand how to build domain models which support the explanation of an AI system's behavior. I have also had the chance to do research in Numerical Algorithms affiliated with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences <a href = "https://www.pims.math.ca/">(PIMS)</a> and the Applied Mathematics Institute <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~yauwong/AMI.htm">(AMI)</a> where I better contributed to the understanding and developing algorithms for Quasi - Linear PDE's, climate forecasting (Part of the AI Computational Team at the <a href = "https://www.wishartlab.com/">Wishart Lab</a>) and Healthcare (Part of the <a href = "https://thecvc.ca/">Canadian VIGOUR center</a>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
I also am interested in giving back to the community by teaching and mentoring students and sharing my love for <a href = "https://www.robertj1.com/service/">Mathematics and Computer Science</a> and co-leading the ML Theory Reading Group at <a href="https://cohere.for.ai/">Cohere for AI</a>.
Feel free to contact me if any of these interests align with your research or if you have any questions. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
