<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Mathematics and Computer Science at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) under Professor <a href = "http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" style="color: blue;">Animashree Anandkumar (Nvidia)</a>. Currently, I am a senior at the University of Alberta pursuing Honors Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I am also a research intern at Caltech in the Theoretical Computing Science <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/theoretical-computer-science">(TCS)</a> group. Additionally, I work with Professor <a href = "http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/">Martha White</a> and <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/">Adam White (DeepMind)</a> at the Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence <a href = "http://rlai.ualberta.ca/)">(RLAI)</a> Lab and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute <a href = "https://www.amii.ca/">(Amii)</a>. I also work with Professor <a href = "https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/">John Bowman</a> in the Mathematics Department. Previously, I was  a <a href = "https://research.google/outreach/csrmp/">CSRMP</a> Research Scholar at Google AI and collaborated with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/data-platform-analytics/">Microsoft Research</a> as a Data Science Intern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
My research interests include theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning specifcally in Computational Learning Theory, Neural Operators, Optimization Theory and Foundations of Deep Learning . During my time at the Explainable AI <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amiixai/">(xAI)</a> Lab I have seen the necessity that humans must understand how to build domain models which support explanation of an AI system's behaviour. I have also had the chance to do research in Numerical Algorithms afflaited with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences <a href = "https://www.pims.math.ca/">(PIMS)</a> and the Applied Mathematics Institute <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~yauwong/AMI.htm">(AMI)</a> where I better contributed to understanding and developing algorithms for Quasi - Linear PDE's, climate forecasting (Part of the AI Computational Team at the <a href = "https://www.wishartlab.com/">Wishart Lab</a>) and Healthcare (Part of the <a href = "https://thecvc.ca/">Canadian VIGOUR center</a>).

<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
I also am interested in giving back to the community by teaching and mentoring students and sharing my love for <a href = "https://www.robertj1.com/service/">Mathematics and Computer Science</a> and co-leading the ML Theory Reading Group at <a href="https://cohere.for.ai/">Cohere for AI</a>.
Feel free to contact me if any of these interests align with your research or if you have any questions. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
