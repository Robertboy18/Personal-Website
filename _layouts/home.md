I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Mathematics and Computer Science at Caltech under Professor <a href = "http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Animashree Anandkumar (Nvidia)</a>. I am a research intern at Caltech in the Theoretical Computing Science <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/theoretical-computer-science">(TCS)</a> group. I graduated from the University of Alberta with a degree in Honors Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. My research interests include theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning specifically in Computational Learning Theory, Neural Operators, Optimization Theory and Foundations of Deep Learning.

<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
I used to work with Professor <a href = "http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/">Martha White</a> and <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/" >Adam White (DeepMind)</a> at the Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence <a href = "http://rlai.ualberta.ca/)">(RLAI)</a> Lab and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute <a href = "https://www.amii.ca/">(Amii)</a>, as well as with Professor <a href = "https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/">John Bowman</a> in the Mathematics Department. I was a CSRMP Research Scholar at <a href = "https://research.google/outreach/csrmp/">Google AI</a> and collaborated with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/data-platform-analytics/">Microsoft Research</a> as a Data Science Intern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
I also did research in Numerical Algorithms affiliated with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences <a href = "https://www.pims.math.ca/">(PIMS)</a> and the Applied Mathematics Institute <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~yauwong/AMI.htm">(AMI)</a> where I better contributed to the understanding and developing algorithms for Quasi - Linear PDE's, climate forecasting (AI Computational Team - <a href = "https://www.wishartlab.com/">Wishart Lab</a>), Healthcare (<a href = "https://thecvc.ca/">Canadian VIGOUR center</a>) and Explainable AI <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amiixai/">(xAI)</a>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;">
I also am interested in giving back to the community by teaching and mentoring students and sharing my love for <a href = "https://www.robertj1.com/service/">Mathematics and Computer Science</a> and co-leading the ML Theory Reading Group at <a href="https://cohere.for.ai/">Cohere for AI</a>.
Feel free to contact me if any of these interests align with your research or if you have any questions. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. My resume is available <a href = "https://www.robertj1.com/assets/pdf/resume.pdf">here</a>.
