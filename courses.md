</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">This course focuses on ethics issues in Artificial Intelligence ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS). The main themes are privacy, fairness/bias, and explainability in DS. The objectives are to learn how to identify and measure these aspects in outputs of algorithms, and how to build algorithms that correct for these issues. The course will follow a case-studies based approach, where we will examine these aspects by considering real-world case studies for each of these ethics issues. The concepts will be introduced through a humanities perspective before a technical treatment including implementation work.</td>

The course will take an information-processing approach to the study of intelligence and briefly touch on perspectives from psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. The course will use the University of Alberta MOOC on Reinforcement Learning. Any student who understands the material in this course will understand the foundations of much of modern probabilistic artificial intelligence (AI) and be prepared to take more advanced courses, or to apply AI tools and ideas to real-world problems.</td>
