Hello everyone,

<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
As the winter semester comes to a close, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the amazing experiences and opportunities that came my way. This semester, I worked hard in my coursework, took on new challenges, and made meaningful contributions to my community. I am particularly grateful for the chance to participate in research projects, where I had the privilege of collaborating with exceptional professors and peers, and gained valuable insights and skills.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
As I prepare to graduate, I'm excited about what the future holds. In particular, I'm thrilled to share that I'll be continuing my academic journey at Caltech, where I'll be pursuing a graduate degree. I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity and excited to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the scientific community.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
Before I embark on this new chapter, I'm looking forward to spending quality time with my loved ones and taking some much-needed time to recharge. It's been a busy and challenging year, but I feel grateful for all that I've accomplished and for the support and encouragement that has helped me along the way.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
Thank you all for being a part of this journey with me. I can't wait to see what the future has in store!
</p>
