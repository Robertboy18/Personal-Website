Hey Everyone~

I just finished my sophomore year of University in April and the past couple of months have been really fruitful and I have really learnt a lot in Mathematics/ML/AI as well as started two clubs at the University of Alberta and also was a Research and Teaching Assistant. I truly enjoyed this academic year by being with my family and online lessons have been a bliss for me.
