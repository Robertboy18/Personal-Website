Hey Everyone~

I just finished my Junior year of University in April and the past couple of months have been fruitful. I have learned a lot in Mathematics/Machine Learning/AI as well as a Research and Teaching Assistant. I truly enjoyed this academic year by being with my family and in person, lessons have been bliss for me. I have met wonderful professors, and I have also been able to work with some great people and meet great people in the community.
