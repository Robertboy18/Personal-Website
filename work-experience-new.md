I am one of the organizers for the ML Theory Learning group at [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.for.ai/) and we will be having our session's bi-weekly from 2 - 3 pm MST! If you aren't a part of this wonderful community feel free to apply through this [form](https://share.hsforms.com/10OrjljwpQ52ILJA6ftENIwch5vw) to join us.

This community is amazing and we have tons of other reading groups and I personally am enjoying the Reinforcement Learning Reading group events, Fireside talks and other events that the community holds. Its a really supportive environment, intellectually motivating and you definitely are going to find atleast one person who shares the same research interest as you.
