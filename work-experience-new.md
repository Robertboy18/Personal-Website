This community is amazing and we have tons of other reading groups and I personally am enjoying the Reinforcement Learning Reading group events, Fireside talks and other events that the community holds. Its a really supportive environment, intellectually motivating and you definitely are going to find atleast one person who shares the same research interest as you.

# First Session

We had the ML Theory Learning group's first session, which was a great success. We discussed what we all hope to gain out of this reading group, our mission statement (which is subject to change over time) as well as potential topics we could cover. I am super excited to see where this group goes and I hope to see you all there!

We are a non-profit ML research lab and community exploring the unknown, together.
