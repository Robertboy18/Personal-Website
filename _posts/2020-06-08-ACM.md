Hey Everyone~
<hr>
I am so excited to anounce that I recently got the chance to start the University of Alberta Student Chapter. This is an exciting opportunity for the UofA Student Chapter to get more resources supported by the top tech companies as well help student developers grow.

#### What is the Associate Computing for Machinery (ACM)?  

ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and professional networking.

#### What is a student chapter?  

Student Chapters provide unique opportunities for networking, mentoring and bonding over common interests. They provide support both within the student community and to local communities outside the institution.

It has been a long journey to be honest and it took time almost a month to officially get accepted to start the club. I am truly grateful to my fellow peers and the faculty sponsor [Prof. Jose Nelson Amaral](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~amaral/) for guiding me as well as giving me a chance to start this chapter.

<hr>
I will be serving as the chair and founder of the University of Alberta Student Chapter and am so excited as to see what this year as well as the future years hold for us and particularly the club.

P.S. I will be updating this page reguarly as soon as we create the chapter website as well as any new updates with this club. I hope the effort I put into this club truly helps a lot of students as well as the local community in Alberta.
