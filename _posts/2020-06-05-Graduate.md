Hey Everyone~
<hr>
This is one of the projects I built using different machine learning techniques. The goal here would be to predict the “Chance of Admit” based on the different parameters that are provided in the dataset.

This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The test scores and GPA are in the older format. The dataset is owned by Mohan S Acharya.
