Hey Everyone~
<hr>
In this post I shall be discussing on what the Putnam is and what to expect from this exam, my thoughts on this exam while I was writing it and also my results.

**What is the Putnam?**   

The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is the preeminent mathematics competition for undergraduate college students in the United States and Canada. The Putnam Competition takes place annually on the first Saturday of December. The competition consists of two 3-hour sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. During each session, participants work individually on 6 challenging mathematical problems.  


In simple terms - **Hardest Math Exam in the World**

The best way to describe the Putnam is :  

If “real math” is like basketball, then the Putnam Exam is like a trick shot competition.

That is to say, not doing well on the Putnam doesn’t really say anything about your potential as a real mathematician, just as an inability to sink a three-point shot blindfolded on one leg while reciting Casey at the Bat shouldn’t keep you out of the NBA.

But, if you can sink such a shot, then you (a) have some pretty serious bragging rights, and (b) might have a higher likelihood to succeed in the NBA. By the same token, doing well on the Putnam exam is certainly a nice point of pride, and should give you a warm fuzzy feeling about your mathematical future. But just a small one though… don’t lose your head. :)

In any event, I get the feeling most people take the exam because they think it’s fun, not to prove anything (ha, see what I did there?) There are math majors who hate that kind of thing, and that’s fine too.
