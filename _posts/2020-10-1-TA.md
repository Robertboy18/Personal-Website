**Decima Robinson Centre**

Welcome to the Decima Robinson Support Centre for Mathematical and Statistical Sciences.
Do you need some help with one of your 100- or 200-level mathematics or statistics courses? This is the place to go!

We offer comprehensive support for students taking introductory mathematics and statistics courses at the University of Alberta.

We are located in 528 CAB (Central Academic Building), and generally are open between 9 AM and 3 PM on weekdays when classes are taught, during the Fall and Winter terms. 
The Centre is staffed by graduate students who are available to offer one-on-one help to students with their homework on a drop-in basis. We also offer exam study sessions for select courses, a Precalculus program for students who are looking to refresh their high school math skills while taking a calculus course, weekly review seminars, and a University Mathematics Primer Course to help high school students make the transition to university.
Did you know? The Decima Robinson Support Centre was named after Decima Robinson, the first BSc graduate at the University of Alberta. Decima Robinson graduated with a major in mathematics in 1911. 

<hr>
I will be assisting students with Honors Calculus I/II and Honors Linear Algebra I/II and Real Analysis as well as Topology and Statistics.
