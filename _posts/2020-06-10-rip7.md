Hey Everyone~
<hr>
This is a really exciting post as I recently got the chance to participate in the [National Undergraduate Big Data Challenge 2020](https://stemfellowship.org/2020-undergraduate-big-data-challenge/) conducted by [STEM Fellowship](https://stemfellowship.org/).  
This was such an amazing chance for me to put the knowlegde that I have gained into a project. I learnt a lot while collaborating with my fellow peers [Hamza Qureshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamza-qureshi-97674016b/) and [Shonnae Frazer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shonnaefrazer/).
