Hey Everyone
<hr>
I finally finished my Junior year fall semester and without a doubt, this semester had its own set of challenges but I am super happy that I did it to the best of my abilities as well as overall had a fun time meeting everyone on campus again and socializing with everyone. I 

My favorite course probably for this semester was Advanced Algorithms ie CMPUT 304. I learned a lot in that class and the assignments were amazing and challenging as well as it was a pleasure to learn under Professor Zachary. I also learned a lot about the theory of algorithms and how to implement them and finally learned much in detail about Complexity Theory. I also fairly enjoyed Intermediate Machine Learning under Professor Martha White and it was a super fun course to learn about more of the theory behind Machine Learning and also implement Neural Networks and other advanced architectures in Julia.

Partial Differential Equations was amazing and challenging too. Numerical Algorithms was another fun course that I liked and probably would love to do research in that area, especially in the realm of approximation algorithms and how to at least get a reasonable optimal solution for NP-Hard problems.

Community Service Learning was an extremely fun course that I took as my arts option (CSL 100). I expect to enhance my community knowledge: and understand community service learning. I'm very excited about my placement, one reason being that I did not expect to get an opportunity to get out of the classroom and experience the community. I will talk more about this in another post. Finally, for the winter break, I will just be chilling as well as try to be more productive and such and enjoy myself with my friends and family.

Hope you all have a great winter break and Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
