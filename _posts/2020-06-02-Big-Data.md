Hey Everyone~
<hr>
This is a really exciting post as I recently got the chance to participate in the [National Undergraduate Big Data Challenge 2020](https://stemfellowship.org/2020-undergraduate-big-data-challenge/) conducted by [STEM Fellowship](https://stemfellowship.org/).  
This was such an amazing chance for me to put the knowlegde that I have gained into a project. I learnt a lot while collaborating with my fellow peers [Hamza Qureshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamza-qureshi-97674016b/) and [Shonnae Frazer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shonnaefrazer/).

The Jupyter notebook is embedded below and some of the analysis is shown below

I literally feel that if I had more time I definitely would have added more information and analysis but I was travelling and my schedule was hectic.  
Funny story : I was in the Toronto International Airport transit while I was writing up the Discussions and Results/Methods and Materials section in the 3 hour waiting period before my next flight to Germany.  
This overall was a fun journey and hopefully next year I will participate in this wonderfuly competition again and do much better.
