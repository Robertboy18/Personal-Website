Hey Everyone~
<hr>
I finally finished my Junior year fall semester and without doubt this semester had its own set of challenges but I am super happy that I did it to the best of my abilities as well as overall had a fun time meeting everyone on campus again and socializing with everyone. I 

My favorite course probably for this semester was Advanced Algorithms ie CMPUT 304 . I learnt a lot in that class and the assignments were amazing and challenging as well as it was a pleasure to learn under professor Zachary. I also learned a lot about the theory of algorithms and how to implement them and finally learnt much in detail about Complexity Theory. I also fairly enjoyed Intermediate Machine Learning under professor Martha White and it was actually a super fun course to learn about more of the theory behind Machine Learning and also implement Neural Networks and other advanced architectures in Julia.

Partial Differential Equations was amazing and challenging too. Numerical Algorithms was another fun course which I liked and probably would love to do research in that area especially in the realm of approximation algorithms and how to atleats get a reasonable optimal solution for NP Hard problems.

Community Service Learning was an extremely fun course which I took as my arts option (CSL 100). My expectations are to enhance my knowledge about community: understand what community service learning. I'm very excited for my placement, one reason being is that I did not expect to actually get an opportunity to get out of the classroom and experience the community. I will talk more about this in another post.

Finally for the winter break I will just be chilling as well as try to be more productive and such and enjoy with my friends and family.

Hope you all have a great winter break and Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
