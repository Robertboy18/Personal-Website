Hey Everyone~

It gives me immense pleasure to announce that I am the Founder/Student Lead @[Google](https://dsc.community.dev/u/mzf2df/#/about) for the University of Alberta.

This is truly a great opportunity for me to connect with like minded peers from all over the world representing different Universities as well as google developers and it is 
the first time the University of Alberta has a Student Lead and I hope to bring more resources to the University as well as grow and learn from this wonderful Community.  
<hr>
I also hope to use my knowledge to promote technology to various local communities in Edmonton and connect with different clubs across North America and host events for the University of Alberta students Online relating to various topics such as Technology, Mathematics, Computer Science and various other topics.
I am grateful for this opportunity and hope to do my best and bring students closer to the various resources that are available at google developer technologies.
