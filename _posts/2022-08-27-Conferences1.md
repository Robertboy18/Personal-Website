Hey Everyone~
<hr>
It's been a busy and challenging fall semester for me, but it has also been incredibly rewarding.

I took on a heavy course load, with a total of 6 classes. These courses were all quite challenging, but I found them to be very engaging and rewarding. I learned so much from my professors and my peers, and I feel like I've grown a lot as a student. My favorite course this semester was definitely MATH 411, I enjoyed complex analysis a lot and just everything was so beautiful how one time differentiability implies infinite times differentiability (aka Holomorphic) to the Riemann Open Mapping theorem and the beautiful Residue Theorem. We also got the chance to learn more about the Prime Number Theorem and Fourier Analysis.

I also enjoyed MATH 436 where I learnt more about the theory of PDEs and Functional Analysis. CMPUT 366 was just hands down a brilliant and fun course with Professor Levi as we covered so many topics from Classical Planning Algorithms to Multiagent algorithms to Pathfinding and so on. 

In addition to my coursework, I also took on a teaching assistant position for two classes (MATH 117 and CMPUT 304). This was a great opportunity for me to gain experience in teaching and to learn more about the material I was studying. It was also a chance for me to give back to the community by helping other students succeed.

In addition to my coursework and teaching responsibilities, I also had the opportunity to work on two research projects this semester. CMPUT 499 was super fun too and I learnt more about the Representers theorem and Functional analysis which helped me to work more on the research project on Kernel Representations. These projects were both very exciting and gave me the chance to delve deeper into my studies and explore new areas of interest.

Overall, it was a very busy and challenging fall semester for me, but I am so grateful for all of the opportunities that I had. I feel like I have grown a lot as a student and as a person, and I am excited to see what the future holds. I also attended the NeurIPS 2022 conference for the first time to present our work on Incremental Foruier Neural Operators at the AI4Science Workshop (Joint work with the team at Caltech).

Hope you all have a great winter break and Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
