Hey Everyone~
<hr>
So AI Week recently happened and I thoroughly enjoyed the event. I met tons of great people and got a chance to talk to some of the most interesting people in the world, especially in RL research. I finally got a chance to meet with Professor Rich Sutton, Michael Bowling, Adam White and many more at DeepMind, Amii, AltaML, Google Brain, and many more.


I also enjoyed the Academic Symposium where I had the chance to learn more about the various AI Labs that are funded by Amii as well as the work they do. The poster session was great as well as the technical talks that were given by the various labs. The final talk by Sutton on Artificial General Intelligence was very interesting and I learned a lot from it.

Lastly, I enjoyed the parties hosted and the various peer networking sessions which was the highlight of my week. I had a lot of fun and met some of the most interesting people in my life and made good lasting relationships. The food was great too and the whole decoration set up in the offices was super pretty!

I wanted to give a shout out to the AI Week team for all they did last week to make AI Week a success and I hope to see you all next year at AI Week!
