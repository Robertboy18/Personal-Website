Hey Everyone~
<hr>
If you are interested in Machine Learning Theory, Computational Complexity, Reinforcement Learning and other cool stuff, check out my Reading List below. I will be updating this list as I read more papers and books.
<hr>

#### Reading List - Machine Learning Theory
* Foret, Pierre, et al. "Sharpness-aware minimization for efficiently improving generalization." arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.01412 (2020).
* Nakkiran, Preetum. 2021. Towards an Empirical Theory of Deep Learning. Doctoral dissertation, Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

#### Reading List - Reinforcement Learning
* Salimans, Tim, et al. "Evolution strategies as a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.03864 (2017).
* Sutton, R.S. & Barto, A.G., 2018. Reinforcement learning: An introduction, MIT press.

#### Reading List - Computational Complexity
* Dean, Walter, "Computational Complexity Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2021 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2021/entries/computational-complexity/>.

On the other hand, I am one of the organizers for the ML Theory Learning group at [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.for.ai/) and we will be having our first session this saturday from 2 - 3 pm MST! If you aren't a part of this wonderful community feel free to apply through this [form](https://share.hsforms.com/10OrjljwpQ52ILJA6ftENIwch5vw) to join us.

This community is amazing and we have tons of other reading groups and I personally am enjoying the Reinforcement Learning Reading group events, Fireside talks and other events that the community holds. Its a really supportive environment, intellectually motivating and you definitely are going to find atleast one person who shares the same research interest as you.
