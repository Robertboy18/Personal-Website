Hey there everyone. I am interested in many a things and I hope I can showcase how much I love Competitive Programming, Machine Learning , Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Problem Solving especially in Mathematics through this blog.  

Excited to exhibit my projects and solutions to various problems. I want to get into research particularly in the field of Mathematics (Analytic Number theory or Numerical Algorithms) and in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science. I hope you all would have fun reading this blog and learning something new.
