Hey there everyone. I honestly am interested in a lot of things and I hope I can showcase how much I love Competitive Programming, Machine Learning , Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Problem Solving especially in Mathematics.  

Excited to showcase my projects and solutions to various problems. I want to get into research particularly in the field of Mathematics (Analytic Number theory or Topology) and in the field of Computer Science particularly Artificial Intelligence.I hope you all have a fun time reading this blog and learn something new.
