I am very much interested in giving back to the community and sharing my love for Mathematics and computer science with everyone. Throughout my time at the University of Alberta, I have been involved in various clubs/groups and some of them are listed below:
</p>

## STEM Clubs

<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
I spend most of my time at the <a href = "https://alberta.campuslabs.ca/engage/organization/MSS">Mathematical and Statistical Society (MSS) </a>where I am currently a Treasurer and we host game nights every Friday as well as other events such as quizzes, integration bees, workshops and seminars.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
I was also the founder of the <a href = "https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-alberta/">Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)</a> at the University of Alberta. We hosted workshops, seminars and other events (around 40 in total) to help students learn more about Google technologies and to help them build projects using these technologies. I was also in charge of creating the website and we collaborated with companies and other clubs from across North America. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
I also helped found the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Student chapter at the University of Alberta. We hosted workshops, seminars and other events to help students and high schoolers to learn more about computer science and to help them build projects using these technologies.

#### Other STEM Clubs which I think are awesome/been involved with:

* Undergraduate Artificial Intelligence Society (UAIS)
* Undergraduate Association of Computing Science (UACS)
* Undergraduate Physics Society (UPS)
* Ada's Team
* Alberta Competitive Programming Club (ACPC)
* Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Student Society (AIMSS) 
* Students for Machine Learning in Business (SMLB)
* Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project (ARVP)


## Research Groups

<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
My time at the <a href = "https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/undergraduate-research-initiative/index.html">Undergraduate Research Initiative (URI) </a>was very fruitful. I was a Peer Undergraduate Research Liason and an Undergraduate reviewer where I helped support URI through involvement in promotion and outreach activities, event logistics and support and peer-advising related research opportunities & reviewed Undergraduate journals. I love doing research, and I'm passionate about guiding undergrads and helping others find research-related jobs.

## Non-STEM Clubs

<p style="text-align:justify; hyphens: auto;" hspace="30">
I was also the Treasurer of the <a href = "https://www.ualberta.ca/st-josephs/community/groups/catholic-students-association/index.html">Catholic Student Association </a>. I helped support the various events planned for the previous academic year as well as grew in my faith and supported the CSA community.

#### Other Non-STEM Clubs which I think are awesome/been involved with:

* Team Up Science
* Campus UNICEF
* Undergraduate Philosophy Society (UPS)
