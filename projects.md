Hey everyone~  
<hr>
Throughout my life I have learnt to apply my skills in something which would benifit others or rather showcase my skills through some projects or publications. Each project relates to something I have learnt in the field of Computer Science or Mathematics or in general.
I hope my skills and the knowledge I have gained are reflected through these projects.
